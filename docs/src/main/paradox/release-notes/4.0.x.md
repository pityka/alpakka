# Alpakka 4.0.x

@@@ note { title="Major version change" }
The major version tick for Alpakka is due to major upgrades and changes in the dependencies used by the various connectors.
Some Alpakka APIs changed as well, but we try to keep those changes minimal.

To understand the forces on version numbers, read about @ref:[Alpakka's versioning scheme](../other-docs/versioning.md).
